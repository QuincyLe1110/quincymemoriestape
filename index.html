        <p>I don't know about you but high school is the best years of my life.</p>
        <p>Even though it's not a place in which I thrived and grew up, doesn't mean it's not worth remembering. This project is for rewinding myself those good old days with my high school fellows.</p>

          <div class="first summary">
          <p>Ashfield College is the destination that I chose for my final high school year because I wanted a better education. Although I only spent 6 months here, I have accessed to new knowledge and grown up a lot. I have made a lot of new friends of different origins, through which I could explore and understand more about their cultures and religions. </p>
          <p>However, the important lesson I learned during this time of staying is never taking things for granted. Due to the Co-vid 19, my high school years ended suddenly on a random day in March while I was so delighted as I didn't have to sit my Mock exams. Just when I received news that the school would close until September did I truly realize that philosophy. Not having a graduation, yearbook photo are the biggest loss in every student's life. </p>

          <p>Every year our school holds a talent competition between classes called "Shine". This is the first Shine competition I took part in with my classmates. Eventhough we didn't make it to next round, we had a lot fun and got to know more about each other</p>

          <p>Everytime someone mentions camping, I just want to burst out in tears. No cap, camping is the most beautiful time in any Phan Chau Trinh High School Students' memories. It taught us the discipline, the creativity, the ability to work with each other to complete tasks. It created a foundation for a united class. It glued us together in an unexpected way. Although there are fights, arguements, disaprovements, stresses and times we don't even talk to each other and want to quit it all, we have made it through. Later, when we sat back with each other, we all agree the fact that this is the best thing that ever happened to us and wished we could go back to that times.  </p>
